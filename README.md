# CS-255

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

- DriverPass is a client who is wanting to create a web application to allow customers to study and practice for their DMV license test, the program should include testing and course work material, a login function, an appointment scheduling function with options for different packages as well as the system being updated with the DMV’S current rules and laws. 


**What did you do particularly well?**

- I felt like I did well describing the hardware and infrastructure needs for this program as well as software needs as well as providing a UML class diagram that meets the needs of the user requirements. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

- I could improve on my use case diagram as I left some use cases out such as account creations / registrations as well as overall organization of the use case diagram. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

- Analyzing the transcript and the client’s requirements to ensure the application follows a user-centered design that meets the client’s needs and leaves them satisfied while fulfilling the void market goal they had in mind. Understanding the user’s needs avoids unnecessary features that could potentially be a waste of time. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

- I approach designing software with a user centered design mindset in place to ensure their needs are met while properly thinking and applying design patterns and OOP principles to ensure the application will be easy to follow and contain reusable code. In the future I will apply more a more agile approach to my document design to create a more efficient process that can adapt to changes if needed.
